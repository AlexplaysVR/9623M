<p style="color:white">At Today's meeting we will be beginning prototyping of a single flywheel launcher and a dual flywheel launcher. But before that, Alex will teach the rest of the team how to write in the notebook and make entries using HTML.</p>

<p style="color:white">While waiting for everyone to arive to today's meeting. We noticed a few new people that joined the WA Robotics Team. This resulted into us gaining a member! Introducing, {Placeholder}. He will be a builder, student programmer, and a potential drive box member. Things will most likly go a bit slower these next couple days since Alex is the only veteran member on the team. After introducing {Placeholder} to the rest of the team. Alex went over today's objectives and recapped over last meeting. Alex explained how to write notebook entries using this site and some simple HTML Syntax. Luckily most of the team is intrested in learning how to program, so everyone got this down pretty easily. We then started working on prototypes. Overall the team decided we were going to start with building a Dual Flywheel first. After some simple building technique from Alex, The team built 2 Flywheels and a Steel Base for Testing. This is shown in the images below</p>
