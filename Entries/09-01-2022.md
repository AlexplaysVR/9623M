<p style="color:white">During Today's Meeting, We continued working on our Dual Flywheel Prototype. We were informed by holmes that we didn't need to rebuild and entire new base because Alex helped rhett build one before. So to get moving along to we can get to more competitions, we've changed to working on an intake prototype (We will still use the Flywheels that we created before for our final design, And testing on the flywheel will happpen after intake is finished). We are building a temperary mecanum base to create intake prototypes, We managed to get the 2 halfs of the mecanum base parially completed by ran into issues while trying to put the 2 halfs together. The mecanum halfs are put together using spacers, and our spacing was off because the vex holes didn't line up. Causing some headache at the end of the meeting</p>
