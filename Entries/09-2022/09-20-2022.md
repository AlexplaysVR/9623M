<h3 style="color:white">Planning:</h3>
<p style="color:white">During Today's Meeting, We are going to redecide who's going to work on what because we are now one less member. We will continue working on our proto types and hopefully get at least one running prototype.</p>
<h3 style="color:white">Prototyping:</h3>
<p style="color:white">We eventually decided that Alex will be working on the flywheel, Taven and Micheal will be working on the Base, and Brayden & Micheal will work on our intake prototype. </p>
<p style="color:white">Alex started working on the double flywheel prototype. He's currently working on a program to display active flywheel rpm on the V5 Display, More information on that can be found in the Coding Entry that Alex made. But for the physical flywheels he still needed to put them together. He used previous knowledge of the flywheels to determine that he will need to use a gear ratio in order to launch these discs. As of right now he is going to try to use a Green motor with a 1:25 gear ratio setting the max flywheel rpm at 5000. By the end of today's meeting he had gotten the outer shells of the flywheel gearbox and added all the highstreingh bearing blocks. He will resume progress next meeting</p>
