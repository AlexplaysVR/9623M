<h3 style="color:white">Planning:</h3>
<p style="color:white">At today's robotics meeting, we will be coninuing with our intake prototype, last meeting we managed to get a sheet of plexiglass with a metal fram put together. But, at today's meeting we are going to try to attach it to some sort of support on the base. Depending on if we have time, either this meeting or next we will start working on the motorized part of this intake .</p>

<h3 style="color:white">Prototyping:</h3>
<p style="color:white">During the Beggining of the meeting, We managed to get the plexiglass attached to the structure on the base. But then got stumped when the slop wasn't doing well scooping rings off the ground. We decided to have a full team meeting about how progress is going and how we should move forward. After the couple of weeks of meeting the team has already learned a lot of building skills. Alex now believes it's a good idea to split up work in half across the team to allow everyone to be working together, this will also double our progress. </p>
<p style="color:white">We have just recieved information regarding Tate, Due to scheduling with other programs. He will no longer be able to be on the team. This was a hard moment for the team because it messed up the work split.</p>
<p style="color:white">At the end of this meeting, We made the decision to have 2 people working on the Flywheel and 2 people working on the intake. We split up and began working. Didn't have much time to get started. But got some games plans set out. -End of Robotics-</p>
