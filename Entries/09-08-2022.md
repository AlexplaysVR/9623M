<p style="color:white">Today during robotics we are planning on getting some sort of intake prototype put together now that we have our base together. We are going to try to use a piece of curved plexiglass.</p>

<p style="color:white">Our first issue we had to tackle today was trying to find a way to bend the plexiglass and keep it in a specific shape. We found a piece of plexiglass that was used last season by Alex's Previous team. We drilled holes into 6 spots on the plexiglass and screwed it into 2 long pieces of flat steel. This allows us to bend the plexiglass and the steel keeps it from going back to it's flat position.</p>

<h2 style="color:red">Add Pictures of Plexiglass with Flat Metal Frame Next Meeting!</h2>

<p style="color:white">Our second task was to find a way to attach the plexiglass to the base. At first, we tried screwing into 3-inch standoffs. This looked good on paper until we got it together and realized the disks couldn't fit in between the 2 standoffs. we tried a c-channel, zipties, and small metal supports and still couldn't figure it out today. We will coninue trying to solve this when we return at next weeks meeting</p>
